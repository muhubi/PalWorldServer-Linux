# PalWorldServer-Linux
_**Project is now archived due to PalServer VM being shutdown and moved to a Docker container for stability and security reasons**._

Some how-tos, guides, and scripts I use to improve my own personal PalWorld Server running on a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Linux Virtual Server

Disclaimer: This repo assumes the user already has a Linux Server running and understands basic terminal commands and scripting.
